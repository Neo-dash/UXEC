Millennium Gloucester Hotel London,4 18 Harrington Gardens Kensington and Chelsea London SW7 4LH United Kingdom, the hotel is recently refurbished and all areas look modern and clean set not too far from anywhere but far enough to know you ve had a walk our room although compact was fine with a good bathroom wardrobe space and comfy bed i didnt notice complimentary water or robes though   it is compact and the rooms and corridors were rather small apparently i was upgraded to an executive room which to be honest confused me because it was by no means special a smaller room or with less furnishings would have received a severely poor review from me its one of those hotels that borderlines just about good enough to utterly unacceptable there is loads of them like this in this area the trick is to book the best room you can and avoid budget deals as you would be better off in a premier inn or something luxury is available here i could see just need to find the sweet spot of cost to comfort finally its somehow out of the way not that near to tube stops or any real area as such being by bayswater its sort of no mans land because the park dominates funny though that its still a noisy area BUT it is close enough to Ox st to grab a cab from the door for 7 ,51.4935083,-0.1834346,neutral,0

The Rockwell,181 Cromwell Road Kensington and Chelsea London SW5 0SF United Kingdom, A good lift that serves all floor The room is very clean there is a fridge safe coffee tea making area with kettle hairdryer cable tv and amenities like shoe polishing mitt white company complimentary shower hair wash shower cap and sewing kit I like the strong shower pressure and despite being a single room the shower is a good size The soundproofing of the room is quite good in comparison to some other hotels in the sense that you can only hear the immediate person next to you but in a muffled way The front reception still manages to always smile and greet when I walk by despite sweltering in the heat without relief The room service staff I ran into on my way out the first day was really friendly and turned out my room really nicely when I returned Wifi signal was medium to strong and I had no problems connecting my phone and laptop The signal does however mysteriously drop disappear between midnight to 1am Accessibility is good if you are keen on being in the Kensington area It is a quick walk to Earl s Court station The 10 minutes walk is full of restaurants e g Lebanese fast food joints e g Mac cafes and supermarkets Sainsbury Co op so you can pick up any necessity on the way out or in The station has lifts so it is handy if you have heavy suitcases like me or if you have kids or walking difficulties   It was an exceptionally hot weekend in the high 28 degrees The air con is really one of the radiator hybrid thing that is fitted under the window and as one knows that s good when it s emitting hot air rises but useless for cool air sinks In fact though set at 17 degrees the temperature never fell below the low 20s However it does serve as a fan function which is better than many non air conditioned accommodation in London The other problem was the threadbare really old and rough and tatty bathrobe For me if there is a bathrobe there needs to be slippers even disposable ones but there aren t And the condition of the bathrobe makes it very uncomfortable and abrasive to wear after a shower on your naked skin I would recommend either replacing or eliminating it The last issue I had was with the bed and I rarely criticise bedding as I am quite a versatile sleeper Perhaps it s because it is a single bed for a single room so it has been easily misshapen by all the frequent uses Basically it is a very soft bed that is very lightweight heavier better quality mattresses will hold its shape and position better placed against the wall This means that guests especially if they are more than average build will find themselves naturally leaning towards the right outer edge away from the wall Thus the mattress is slanted and when I lay my size 14 5ft 8 inches body on it to sleep I found myself having to stop myself from falling off the bed a few times Rather disconcerting For those travelling with a car like in most parts of London parking is very limited if any expensive and restrictive ,51.4948059,-0.1926525,neutral,0

Les Matins de Paris Spa,3 rue Clauzel 9th arr 75009 Paris France, The bed itself was great very comfortable I can feel very comfortable in tiny spaces so the size of the room was not a problem for me The room shower and toilet where clean and tidy The temprature in the room was comfortable The breakfast was tasty It is very close to metro stations There is a killer sushi place near by The assistants helped me finding dinners and other facilities near by and printed train schedules for me   Now I only stayed ther for one night With that in mind here is my review The spa area was well not a spa The pool was tiny 5 6 meeters long I could be wrong and the hot room as well as the shower in the spa area smelled like mold The only thing I wanted to do after going into this facility for a brief time was to wash up When I talked to the assistant about it he asked me if an other user maybe caused the smell To which I still roll my eyes The next day the pool was not working so I could not check The bathroom at the room had a wet smell to it as well That was fixed the momnet I opened the windows so taking into consideration the age of buildings in Paris that was not a big problem When I arrived I got informed that they did not have big towels in my room so I should try to manage When I asked to use one of the bathrobes from the spa the assistant said ok When I arrived I was informed that checkout was at 12 00 and if I was any late I would be charged 50 euro per hour also 100 if I was to smoke even though I stated that I am not a smoker The above I had to sign in an agreement Something that I found very unsettling since it would be hard to proove I did not smoke after I left the room and the country I was also informed of the possibility to get a breakfast in the room The assistant felt complied to add that the 13 euro breakfast I payed for the next morning because it is in the room we can not bring everything I informed her I will not use this service Overall the breakfast was nice The only thing I found challenging was to find where the plates and cutlery where kept since they were behind a bar and there was no personnel in the room to seek help from ,48.878932,2.3394182,neutral,0

Best Western Paris Gare Saint Lazare,18 rue de Constantinople 8th arr 75008 Paris France, The shower worked quite well  This could go on for some time This place it appears to be an old converted block of flats from around the 1800 s It has a seriously very narrow central spiral staircase with a lift that was installed at a very much later date and as so does not come to ground floor but appears halfway up a flight of stairs this is the same for all 5 floors Elderly people or those with walking problems will find this either considerably difficult to deal with or even dangerous I am not Joking To reach this lift I a 72 year old man had to carry my heavy luggage up to this lift on my own as no help was offered or given Upon studying this further and reading the emergency escape instructions If the central stairway becomes blocked you are then instructed to remain in your rooms PLEASE NOTE THIS INSTRUCTION BECAUSE THERE ARE NO EXTERNAL FIRE ESCAPES I suppose it s easier to remove bodies this way rather than cleaning up the outside pavements of those who attempted to jump to safety The rooms themselves are just about big enough to take a full size double bed which then leaves about 18 inches either way for you to get round The shower works quite well though and breakfast is just about passable for a cheap hotel OF WHICH THIS ONE IS NOT I do not consider this place value for money NOR DO I RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE ELSE I am also writing to BOOKING COM to make a formal complaint with regard to their promoting this hotel as it is quite obvious no one appears to have checked this place before advertising it ,48.8803752,2.319591,neutral,0

Hotel West End,7 rue Cl ment Marot 8th arr 75008 Paris France, I chose this hotel as I wanted the glamour of the Hotel Plaza Athenee but couldn t afford the 500ish a night they were asking After going into the Plaza during our stay I have to say this is an excellent alternative I would probably choose it over the Plaza after my experience this weekend The location is excellent for a visit to Pairs we were able to walk to the Champs Elyesse very easily and the Eifel Tower is a stone through away It has excellent transport links to other areas of Paris While the Plaza asks for hundreds of pounds a night for a view of the tower we got ours for less than half of that for 493 for two nights The photo attached is the view from our room on the 6th floor mind you I had to lean a little awkwardly out the window to get it What I liked about this hotel was the friendly and intimate feel much unlike the Plaza which felt like a place you d go to be seen The lobby and reception were well decorated and the staff are warm and accommodating They have an honesty system in the front room for drinks which was a nice touch Around the corner at the Plaza they are asking 16 for a bottle of Bud The rooms while small are comfortable and the is minimal noise at night time despite the central location The breakfast was included which was an unexpected surprise they will deliver the continental breakfast to your room for free if you pre order the night before All in all I was very glad I chose this hotel and felt that it was good value for money I would definitely choose this hotel again   Our mini bar wasn t restocked after the last occupant and there were tiny details overlooked in the bathroom hair in the bath tub no face washers The room was a little small but it didn t detract from our enjoyment of our stay For the price though I d expect the basics covered ,48.8671391,2.3038447,neutral,0

Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien,Hietzinger Hauptstra e 10 14 13 Hietzing 1130 Vienna Austria, Very nice hotel beautiful old style Viennese next door to Sch nbrunn and with a nice view of it from the window The room was nice high ceiling and huge windows nice big bed and furnished accordingly in the old Viennese style which fitted perfectly with the ambiance and the atmosphere Very close to subway with direct link to the center Karlsplatz Opera and easy also to find when coming going to the airport   The downside of the huge old style windows was that isolation is not good as expected so if you have a room facing Sch nbrunn you will hear everything that happens in the street like the tram the cars the Church which is close by etc which makes for a very early wakeup Also the isolation regarding temperature is not good standing next to the balcony with the doors closed you could still feel the breeze coming from under the door One other surprising aspect was the cleaning the cleaning ladies came did the cleaning but did not touch an empty bottle of Cola which was on the table for 3 days Also a blouse that was on a chair laid there for 3 days although it would have been a small effort to fold it and put it at least on the chair properly something you would expect from n hotel like this ,48.1866506,16.3023375,neutral,0

Good Hotel London,Western Gateway Newham London E16 1FA United Kingdom, Handy the travel companion was very helpful during our visit   The room is big as a shoe box There is no room for your bags and the window is drafty so you can feel the cold air coming through while you sleep On our first day the shower gel compartment was empty which I found out after getting wet in the shower The staff was cooperative but told us that we had to wait for 15 minutes because they are busy at the moment After dressing up and going to the reception myself I found the 3 of them talking and nobody else at the reception Also for a 4 star hotel I would expect a hair dryer in the room and not having to get one from the front desk One outlet in the toilet was not wired completely so there were wires tucked in a plastic box without a protective cover on it The walls between the rooms are pretty thin so the acoustic insulation is pretty bad you can just hope that your neighbours are not noisy The location is pretty good 2 minutes from the train station but it still takes around 40 minutes to get to the touristy center of London ,51.5084195,0.0253216,neutral,0

St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London,Euston Road Camden London NW1 2AR United Kingdom, Amazing building with great character room very comfortable great location and good evening meal   Booked a suite in the chambers wing for my wife s 40th birthday and having made the booking I called to confirm that our room overlooked the station This was the only reason for booking here as she really wanted to stay in a room with a view of the trains The hotel confirmed that it did so of course you can imagine my surprise when we checked in and were shown to a room overlooking the main road The gentleman who showed us to our room was very apologetic so we followed him back to reception so he could try to find us the correct one He went off and got the rather rude duty manager was not so helpful but eventually they found a room albeit a smaller one than booked overlooking the station We were fine with this as the view was what was important to us not the size of the room On arriving at the new room he apologised again and offered my wife a complimentary bottle of champagne and some cookies for our daughter as an apology which I thought was very kind However 30 minutes later we received a bottle of their cheapest white wine and nothing else Now don t get me wrong a free bottle of wine is a free bottle of wine but why offer something more special if you can t follow through with it No doubt the miserable duty manager who couldn t care less about the whole situation stopped him Sadly my gripes don t end here as the windows in the room were filthy to say the least which meant you could barely see through them to the station this defeating the whole object of staying there I could have accepted this more if they were all dirty but those over the public staircase right next to or room were spotless Added to this a stone cold breakfast they did at least refund this and a big scratch down the side of our car which happened whilst parked using their 50 per night valet service and frankly it was not a good experience ,51.5267769,-0.1324905,neutral,0

The Curtain,45 Curtain Road Hackney London EC2A 4PJ United Kingdom, new clean hotel  The painful experience started with charging full 3 nights GBP1000 for my business partner room despite it was cancelled more than 2 days before check in date due to emergency trip cancellation death in the family Front desk instead of finding a solution to refund the unjustified room charged she put the blame on booking com and told me its there policy which doesn t make sense because Booking com is an e commerce intermediary platform and they don t collect room charges for themselves That was my response then the front desk lady she promised to discuss this matter with higher management and get back to me which never happened No one even bothered to contact me about the subject very bad I felt like been fooled When I checked in my room I discovered a serious security defect in the balcony door it can t close from inside the fixed key is misplaced outside the balcony door and balcony is shared with other rooms so its an easy access from the outside Of course I informed the front desk and the show started each personnel started to throw the blame on somebody else security contractors house keeping quality check it was a nightmare eventually I proposed a solution for them by removing the fixed key from outside the door which ultimately was done On different subject room service I used to leave my room very early for meetings and came back after 5 PM surprisingly my room wasn t serviced so I had to call the housekeeping to make up my room Funny enough on my last day was the weekend the housekeeping came at 8 AM and woke me up despite the sign of do not disturb was hanging outside my door as usual lots of apologies Also the room itself is nicely designed but poorly engineered the bathroom lights switch misplaced by the entrance of the room so if you need to switch ON the lights in the bathroom you have to go all the way to the opposite side of the room ,51.5237209,-0.0806178,neutral,0

Jaz Amsterdam,De Passage 90 Noord Holland Zuidoost 1101 AX Amsterdam Netherlands, I would most definitely return to Jaz Hotel when i next visit Amsterdam It is clean modern and extremely comfortable the check in was a little slow but I suspect this is the staff struggling with a complicated booking system rather than them being slow as every member of staff we came into contact with was charming helpful and efficient they also spoke annoyingly good English But to make it easier for others to make a decision let me address two issues which other reviewers have commented on The Jaz Hotel location in regard to the centre of Amsterdam and the breakfast that is provided It will take you around 30 40 minutes to get to central Amsterdam including walking to the Metro station and then the journey on the train But to be honest it is so simple it feels a whole lot less It will also give you the chance for a little time away from central Amsterdam the location is not picturesque but it does have some great venues you can check out if you are that way inclined Breakfast is continental style and offers a huge selection If you want a fry up every morning your not going to find it here but if you are willing to ditch the old British not like I get at home attitude then you will be more than happy with with the selection I found myself getting back home to England and looking in the stores to find the ingredients to have the same type of breakfast at home that I had during our stay   Check in could have been a little quicker but it was not that big a deal and all the staff were very pleasant and helpful If you want a picturesque hotel location you will not find it here this is a very modern and clean hotel in a very modern setting away from central Amsterdam It suited me perfectly but others may be put off ,52.314371,4.9388064,neutral,0

Mercure Paris Notre Dame Saint Germain des Pr s,20 rue du Sommerard 5th arr 75005 Paris France, While the rooms are small they are totally functional and everything you need is there They make excellent use of the small space and we wanted for nothing We booked a twin room on the 5th floor the windows let in very little noise we had a safe mini fridge bath and shower and enough wardrobe space Hotel staff were very pleasant and friendly The option of express check in out was handy for avoiding delays although we did still need to pick up our key at reception and also pay the room tax on check out which wasn t included in the overall price we paid when booking This is around 2 euro per day per guest so watch out for that The location is a couple of minutes from the nearest metro and a 10 minute walk maximum to the St Michel metro and RER stop which brings you straight to Charles de Gaulle Loads of brasseries in the vicinity and you are just 5 10 minutes from the bustle of St Michel The area is clean and safe and we felt really at ease there   Breakfast if not included in your room rate is 17 euro a day You can grab a coffee and toast croissant down the road for 3euro The small rooms wouldn t suit if you were staying longer than a weekend They have a privilege suite however that looked to be bigger The corridors are VERY narrow and I imagine a claustrophobe s nightmare ,48.8503074,2.3450612,neutral,0
